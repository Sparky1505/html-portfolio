<h3>Steps breakdown</h3>
<p>Now Let's look at at the steps how we can start building the PC</p>

<h4>Step 1 - Installing CPU on Motherboard</h4>
<ol start ="1">
    
    <li>UnWrap the Motherboard and gently place it on top of the Motherboard box</li>
    <li>On top of CPU slot you will see a plastic cover, do not worry about it now. Unclip the bracket and leave it for now</li>
    <li>Unbox the CPU, this is very important part, make sure not to touch the pin in CPU</li>
    <li>Once you carefully took the CPU out of the box, make sure to clearly check the CPU, you will see a white triangle on one of the corner</li>
    <li>You need to align with the exact same triangle in the Motherboard CPU slot</li>
    <li>Once you see it, place the CPU gently and DO NOT press or give any pressure</li>
    <li>Once the CPU is in place, close the CPU bracket, it will automatically pop the plastic cover</li>
</ol>

<p>Now you have successfully completed the step 1 and installed the CPU on the Motherboard. Let's continue</p>
